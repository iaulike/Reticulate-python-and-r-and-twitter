# Reticulate_Python_Twitter

Please click the other .md file to see my code and the output from my project. 

I wrote code with a key to get the tweets. Because a key was required, the code to get the tweets hasn't been included here. Python code to extract the hashtags from the tweets is included. 

I was hoping to run python in a markdown document with the R "reticulate" package but I ran into a number of problems. 

What I could do: I could run a python chunk on my PC and got great output of foreign language twitter hashtags. My r markdown write up of the ten most popular hashtags is included here but the actual hashtags are not. 

I couldn't knit the document as it was, so I can't display the foreign language characters here. 

I couldn't pass the python variables from the python chunk to the r chunk. I have put all the text files up with the tweets in them, though they are too big to open in github, and one day I'll try again to make it work.
