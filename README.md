# Reticulate_Python_Twitter
I was hoping to run python in a markdown document but ran into a number of problems. 
I could run a python chunk and got great output of foreign language twitter hashtags. 
I couldn't knit the document. I couldn't pass the python variables to r. I have put all the text files up with the tweets in them,
and one day I'll try again to make it work.
